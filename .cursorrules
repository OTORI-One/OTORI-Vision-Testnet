# Cursor AI General Rules

These guidelines are intended for the Cursor AI assistant to ensure consistent, high-quality code generation, problem solving, and documentation across projects.

## 1. Code Generation
- **Follow Project Structure:** Adhere to the provided architecture and file organization.
- **Error Handling:** Include proper error boundaries and comprehensive error handling.
- **Comprehensive Comments:** Add clear and complete inline comments and documentation.
- **Type Safety:** Maintain type safety throughout generated code.

## 2. Problem Solving
- **Hybrid Architecture Consideration:** When relevant, consider both off-chain and on-chain components.
- **Document Reasoning:** Clearly document your thought process and reasoning for design choices.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Always include provisions for error cases and edge scenarios.
- **Migration Paths:** Provide clear migration or refactoring guidance when suggesting changes.

## 3. Documentation
- **Keep It Current:** Ensure that all documentation is updated to reflect the latest code changes.
- **Include Examples:** Provide concrete examples and use cases in the documentation.
- **Document Decisions:** Clearly note architectural decisions and any non-obvious design choices.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent style and terminology across all documentation.
