## Current State

### Frontend (ovt-fund)
- Next.js application with TypeScript
- Mock mode enabled for development
- Key components implemented:
  - NAV Visualization
  - Portfolio Management
  - Wallet Connection (using LaserEyes)
  - Price Charts
  - Token Explorer

### Backend (ovt-program)
- Rust program targeting Arch Network
- Currently facing build challenges due to Solana runtime dependencies
- Program includes:
  - NAV calculation and updates
  - Treasury management
  - OVT token operations

## Recent Developments (Updated 10th February 2025)

### 1. Multisig Implementation
- Successfully implemented 3-of-5 multisig for admin operations
- Added comprehensive test suite for multisig verification
- Implemented ECDSA signature validation
- Created test utilities for local multisig testing

### 2. RPC Client Enhancements
- Added caching layer with TTL for improved performance
- Implemented rate limiting and retry logic
- Added network status monitoring
- Enhanced error handling and validation

### 3. Admin Dashboard Progress
- Implemented token minting interface with multisig support
- Added portfolio position management
  - Post-TGE position entry
  - Pre-TGE position entry with SAFE verification
  - Position exit functionality
- Created position tracking and history views

### 4. Security Improvements
- Enhanced validation for NAV updates
- Added transaction verification logic
- Implemented proof validation system
- Added comprehensive error handling

### 5. Testing Infrastructure
- Created local testing environment for multisig operations
- Added test utilities for key generation
- Implemented test scenarios for all critical operations
- Enhanced error case coverage

### 6. Documentation Updates
- Added multisig setup guide to README
- Updated development journal with recent progress
- Enhanced API documentation
- Added test scenario documentation

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Arch CLI Build Issues
- **Challenge**: Building arch-cli v0.1.5 fails due to unresolved Solana runtime functions:
  - `sol_log_pubkey`
  - `sol_log_data`
  - `sol_log_64_`
- **Current Solution**: Using mock mode for frontend development while waiting for:
  - More stable Arch CLI release
  - Complete transition from Solana dependencies
  - Or guidance from Arch Network team

### 2. Development Strategy
Currently pursuing a dual-track approach:
1. **Frontend Development**
   - Proceeding with mock data
   - Implementing and testing UI components
   - Setting up wallet integration

2. **Backend Integration**
   - Awaiting stabilization of Arch Network tools
   - Documenting dependencies and requirements
   - Planning integration points

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Continue frontend development using mock data
2. Monitor Arch Network releases for stable CLI version
3. Document integration points for future backend connection

### Future Considerations
1. **Backend Integration**
   - Plan transition from mock to real data
   - Document required API endpoints
   - Prepare test cases

2. **Testing Strategy**
   - Develop unit tests for components
   - Plan integration testing approach
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
