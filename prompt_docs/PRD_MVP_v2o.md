# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Title:** Arch Integration of AI-Driven Portfolio Rebalancing Agent  
**Owner:** [CTO/Engineering Lead]  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 2025

---

## 1. Overview

The Arch AI-driven portfolio rebalancing agent is a hybrid system designed for high-value institutional portfolios. It leverages off-chain AI inference for complex market analysis and simulation, while utilizing on-chain execution on the Arch network for final rebalancing decisions and settlement on Bitcoin. This approach minimizes on-chain gas fees while ensuring trust and security through Bitcoin-grade finality.

---

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- **Security & Finality:** Ensure that final asset allocations are executed on Bitcoin via Arch for unparalleled settlement security.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Offload heavy computations (AI inference, data processing) to off-chain components to reduce expensive on-chain gas fees.
- **Regulatory Compliance & Auditability:** Maintain an immutable, on-chain record of rebalancing decisions that complies with institutional audit requirements.
- **Flexibility:** Support dynamic portfolio strategies while accounting for legacy or non-traditional investments (e.g., slow-moving SAFT/SAFE pre-TGE investments).

---

## 3. Stakeholders

- **Institutional Investors:** Seeking secure, compliant, and cost-effective portfolio rebalancing.
- **Development Team:** Responsible for building, integrating, and maintaining both on-chain and off-chain components.
- **Operations & Security Teams:** Oversee system audits, compliance, and risk management.
- **Oracle/Data Providers:** Entities supplying market data and custom data feeds (including Bitcoin-inscribed SAFT/SAFE data).

---

## 4. Assumptions

- On-chain execution (smart contract operations, Bitcoin settlements) is costlier than off-chain computations.
- Off-chain components will run on scalable, secure compute platforms (e.g., decentralized compute networks like Akash or trusted centralized cloud services).
- Existing price oracles (e.g., Chainlink) provide standard market data, but specialized tooling is needed for unique data sources such as slow-moving SAFT/SAFE pre-TGE investments.

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Off-Chain Components

- **AI Model for Portfolio Optimization:**  
  - Train and execute neural networks (or alternative ML models) using market data, historical trends, and risk simulations.
  - Must support various asset classes and incorporate portfolio-specific constraints.

- **Data Feed Aggregation:**  
  - Integrate standard price, volatility, and liquidity data via established oracles (e.g., Chainlink).
  - **Custom Data Feeds:** Develop tooling to parse and integrate slow-moving SAFT/SAFE pre-TGE investment data, which is inscribed on Bitcoin. This requires:
    - A dedicated parser using Bitcoin Core APIs or Blockstream’s tools.
    - An on-chain Oracle mechanism to push verified data to Arch smart contracts.

- **Computation & Simulation:**  
  - Execute risk assessments, backtesting, and scenario simulations off-chain.
  - Ensure that decision outputs are accompanied by verifiable proofs (e.g., zk-SNARKs) to attest to adherence with pre-defined rules.

### 5.2 On-Chain Components

- **Smart Contract Logic (Rust-based):**  
  - Accept and enforce AI-generated rebalancing instructions.
  - Implement rules and constraints (e.g., “no allocation >30% to volatile assets”) with built-in safety checks.
  
- **Verification Mechanisms:**  
  - Integrate zk-SNARK or similar proofs to verify that off-chain AI decisions comply with strategy constraints.
  
- **Transaction & Settlement:**  
  - Handle final asset transfers on Arch and settle on Bitcoin, including batching of transactions to reduce fees.
  
- **Audit Trail:**  
  - Log all on-chain rebalancing decisions for full auditability and regulatory compliance.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:**  
  - Enforce secure communication between off-chain and on-chain components.
  - Use formal verification and rigorous security audits for smart contracts.

- **Performance & Latency:**  
  - Off-chain AI and data aggregation systems must deliver near-real-time outputs for timely rebalancing decisions.
  - On-chain processing should be streamlined to minimize gas and settlement fees.

- **Scalability:**  
  - Architecture must accommodate increases in data volume and complexity as more asset types and portfolios are managed.

- **Cost Management:**  
  - Optimize batch processing and minimize on-chain logic to contain gas fees.
  - Monitor Bitcoin network fees and plan rebalancing frequency accordingly.
