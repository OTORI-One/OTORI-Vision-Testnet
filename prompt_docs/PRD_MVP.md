## **8. Technical Specifications**

### **8.1 Arch Program Integration**

- Follow guides for writing Arch programs, fungible tokens, and oracle integrations.
- Use Arch RPC methods for transactions and state queries.

### **8.2 Token Details**

- **OVT Token:**
    - Name: OVT Token.
    - Decimals: 18.
    - Initial Supply: 1,000,000 OVT.

### **8.3 NAV Calculation**

- Fetch portfolio token prices (WBTC, WETH, and OTORI tokens) via oracle.
- Aggregate treasury holdings.
- Calculate NAV per OVT token and emit results.

### **8.4 SAFE Handling in NAV Calculation**

#### **Background**

- OTORI may occasionally invest using SAFEs (Simple Agreements for Future Equity) instead of SAFTs or fungible tokens. These represent agreements for future equity in startups and lack a direct, liquid market value until the next funding round.

#### **SAFE Integration in NAV Calculation**

1. **Data Model for SAFEs**:
    
    - **Attributes**:
        - Company Name.
        - Investment Amount (in BTC or USD).
        - Agreed Valuation Cap and Discount Rate.
        - SAFE Terms (e.g., conversion triggers, unlock time).
    - **Storage**: These SAFEs will be represented as structured data on-chain (using inscriptions or as program state variables).
2. **NAV Adjustment**:
    
    - SAFEs will not have dynamic price feeds. Instead:
        - The NAV program will fetch stored SAFE data.
        - Apply a static multiplier or value placeholder (e.g., estimated future value based on the valuation cap).
        - Include the result as part of the total NAV but flag it separately for frontend display.
3. **Special Case Logic**:
    
    - SAFEs will not update automatically between funding rounds unless:
        - Admin provides a new valuation or conversion details.
        - NAV calculation distinguishes between liquid (tokens) and illiquid (SAFEs) portions.

#### **Example Implementation**:

- **SAFE Struct**:

```solidity
struct SAFE {
    string companyName;
    uint256 investmentAmount;
    uint256 valuationCap;
    uint256 discountRate;
    uint256 unlockTime;
    bool converted;
}

```

- **NAV Pseudocode**:

```js
function computeNAV() external view returns (uint256 navPerOVT) {
    uint256 liquidValue = calculateLiquidAssets();
    uint256 illiquidValue = calculateIlliquidAssets(); // Includes SAFEs
    uint256 totalSupply = OVT.totalSupply();

    uint256 totalValue = liquidValue + illiquidValue;
    return totalValue / totalSupply;
}

```
### **8.5 Buyback and Burn**

- Simulate market transactions to buy OVT at NAV price.
- Burn purchased OVT tokens to reduce supply.

## **9. Risks and Mitigation**

- **Risk:** Dependency on Arch Network stability.
    - **Mitigation:** Develop and test extensively in a local testnet environment.
- **Risk:** Potential delays in developer deliverables.
    - **Mitigation:** Define clear milestones and track progress weekly.

## **11. Testing Strategy**

### **Unit Testing**

- Test smart contract functions in isolation:
    - OVT minting, transfer, and burn.
    - NAV computation for edge cases (e.g., zero total supply, SAFE data misconfiguration).

### **Integration Testing**

- Combine frontend and backend:
    - Test wallet integration and DApp API calls.
    - Verify UI reflects contract state accurately.

### **End-to-End Testing**

- Simulate real user flows:
    - Connect wallet → Buy OVT → View NAV.
    - Execute buyback and verify supply reduction.
